## Description

This assignment was done from scratch, and took me longer than expected. However, I learned a lot in the process and now I better understand how to use Insomnia and test different routes/points with it. For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a Social Network API, where users can be created and updated, users could add, update, or delete thoughts and reactions, and add or delete friends, as well as update or delete thoughts and reactions. What helped me the most in setting up and understnading this assignment was to picture Facebook and what that would look like. I got some help from my Instructor on how to set up a couple of test points in Insomnia, then I was able to do several on my own, and then talked through a few more with my tutor. By the time I completed this assignment, I had a much better understanding of the big picture and how it all works.
